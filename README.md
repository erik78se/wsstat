The aim of this project is to provide a simple and easy to use tool to check the status of a WebSocket endpoint. It is basically trying to do what [reorx/httpstat](https://github.com/reorx/httpstat) and [davecheney/httpstat](https://github.com/davecheney/httpstat) does for HTTP requests, but for WebSocket connections.
